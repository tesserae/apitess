# Introduction

Welcome to the TIS API (Tesserae Intertext Service Application Programming Interface) documentation website.
This website provides information on the TIS API by describing its endpoints and by providing some examples of how the endpoints are supposed to behave.

If you're new to web API's, we recommend you look at [the tutorial](getting-started/tutorial.md) to get your bearings.

If you're comfortable with web API's but new to the TIS API, there is an [example workflow](getting-started/workflow.md) that might be helpful.

If you want to know more about a particular endpoint, find it under the "Endpoints" dropdown menu (found along the top of the page).

## About Us

We, the maintainers of this website, are members of the Tesserae project.  We are interested in exploring computational methods to discover intertextual relationships, primarily in ancient Greek and Latin.

Our current site is available at <https://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/>.

The API described on this site is currently served off of <https://tess-new.caset.buffalo.edu/api/>.
